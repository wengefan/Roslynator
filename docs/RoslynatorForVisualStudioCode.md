# How to Enable Roslynator for Visual Studio Code

## Introduction

* Refactorings and code fixes are supported by VS Code at the moment.

* Analyzers should be supported in future version of VS Code.

## Step by Step Tutorial

1. [Download](http://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=josefpihrt.Roslynator2017) latest extension from Visual Studio Marketplace

2. Change extension from **vsix** to **zip**.

3. Extract zip file.

4. Copy selected libraries to a directory of your choice (for example **C://lib/roslynator**)

   * **Roslynator.Common.dll** (required)
   * **Roslynator.Core.dll** (required)
   * **Roslynator.CSharp.CodeFixes.dll** (contains code fixes for compiler diagnostics)
   * **Roslynator.CSharp.Refactorings.dll** (contains refactorings)

5. Create file at **%USERPROFILE%/.omnisharp/omnisharp.json** with following content:


```json

{
    "RoslynExtensionsOptions": {
        "LocationPaths": [
            "C:/lib/roslynator"
        ]
    }
}

```
